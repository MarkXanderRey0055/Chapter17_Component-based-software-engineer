          <h4>Chapter 17 ■ Component-based software engineering</h4>
          <p>
            As explained in Chapter 16, many new business systems are now
            developed by configuring off-the-shelf systems. However, when a
            company cannot use an off-the-shelf system because it does not meet
            their requirements, the software they need has to be specially
            developed. For custom software, component-based software engineering
            is an effective, reuse-oriented way to develop new enterprise
            systems. Component-based software engineering (CBSE) emerged in the
            late 1990s as an approach to software systems development based on
            reusing software components. Its creation was motivated by
            designers' frustration that object-oriented development had not led
            to extensive reuse, as had been originally suggested. Single object
            classes were too detailed and specific, and often had to be bound
            with an application at compile time. You had to have detailed
            knowledge of the classes to use them, and this usually meant that
            you had to have the component source code. This meant that selling
            or distributing objects as individual reusable components was
            practically impossible. Components are higher-level abstractions
            than objects and are defined by their interfaces. They are usually
            larger than individual objects and all implementation details are
            hidden from other components. CBSE is the process of defining,
            implementing, and integrating or composing loosely coupled,
            independent components into systems. It has become as an important
            software development approach because software systems are becoming
            larger and more complex. Customers are demanding more dependable
            software that is delivered and deployed more quickly. The only way
            that we can cope with complexity and deliver better software more
            quickly is to reuse rather than reimplement software components.
          </p>

        <div class="essential">
          <p>The essentials of component-based software engineering are:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Independent components that are completely specified by their
              interfaces. There should be a clear separation between the
              component interface and its implementation. This means that one
              implementation of a component can be replaced by another, without
              changing other parts of the system.
            </li>
            <li>
              Component standards that facilitate the integration of components.
              These standards are embodied in a component model. They define, at
              the very minimum, how component interfaces should be specified and
              how components communicate. Some models go much further and define
              interfaces that should be implemented by all conformant
              components. If components conform to standards, then their
              operation is independent of their programming language. Components
              written in different languages can be integrated into the same
              system.
            </li>
            <li>
              Middleware that provides software support for component
              integration. To make independent, distributed components work
              together, you need middleware support that handles component
              communications. Middleware for component support handles low-level
              issues efficiently and allows you to focus on application-related
              problems. In addition, middleware for component support may
              provide support for resource allocation, transaction management,
              security, and concurrency
            </li>
            <li>
              A development process that is geared to component-based software
              engineering. You need a development process that allows
              requirements to evolve, depending on the functionality of
              available components. I discuss CBSE development processes in
              Section 17.2. Component-based development embodies good software
              engineering practice. It makes sense to design a system using
              components, even if you have to develop rather than reuse these
              components.
            </li>
          </ol>

          <div class="components">
            <p>
              Underlying CBSE are sound design principles that support the
              construction of understandable and maintainable software:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                Components are independent so they do not interfere with each
                other's operation. Implementation details are hidden. The
                component's implementation can be changed without affecting the
                rest of the system.
              </li>
              <li>
                Components communicate through well-defined interfaces. If these
                interfaces are maintained, one component can be replaced by
                another, which provides additional or enhanced functionality.
              </li>
              <li>
                Component infrastructures offer a range of standard services
                that can be used in application systems. This reduces the amount
                of new code that has to be developed.
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              The initial motivation for CBSE was the need to support both reuse
              and distributed software engineering. A component was seen as an
              element of a software system that could be accessed, using a
              remote procedure call mechanism, by other components running on
              separate computers. Each system that reused a component had to
              incorporate its own copy of that component. This idea of a
              component extended the notion of distributed objects, as defined
              in distributed systems models such as the CORBA specification
              (Pope, 1997). Several different protocols and standards have been
              developed to support this view of a component, such as Sun's
              Enterprise Java Beans (EJB), Microsoft's COM and .NET, and CORBA's
              CCM (Lau and Wang, 2007). In practice, these multiple standards
              have hindered the uptake of CBSE. It was impossible for components
              developed using different approaches to work together. Components
              that are developed for different platforms, such as .NET or J2EE,
              cannot interoperate. Furthermore, the standards and protocols
              proposed were complex and difficult to understand. This was also a
              barrier to their adoption. In response to these problems, the
              notion of a component as a service was developed, and standards
              were proposed to support service-oriented software engineering.
            </p>
            <p>
              The most significant difference between a component as a service
              and the original notion of a component is that services are
              stand-alone entities that are external to a program using them.
              When you build a service-oriented system, you reference the
              external service rather than including a copy of that service in
              your system. Service-oriented software engineering, which I
              discuss in Chapter 19, is therefore a type of component-based
              software engineering. It uses a simpler notion of a component than
              that originally proposed in CBSE. It has been driven, from the
              outset, by standards. In situations where COTS-based reuse is
              impractical, service-oriented CBSE is becoming the dominant
              approach for the development of business systems.
