          There is general agreement in the CBSE community that a component is
          an independent software unit that can be composed with other
          components to create a software system. Beyond that, however, people
          have proposed varying definitions of a software component. Councill
          and Heineman (2001) define a component as:
        </p>
        <i
          >“A software element that conforms to a standard component model and
          can be independently deployed and composed without modification
          according to a composition standard.”</i
        >

        <p class="loyd_p">
          This definition is essentially based on standards so that a software
          unit that conforms to these standards is a component. Szyperski
          (2002), however, does not mention standards in his definition of a
          component but focuses instead on the key characteristics of
          components:
        </p>
        <i
          >“A software component is a unit of composition with
          contractually-specified interfaces and explicit context dependencies
          only. A software component can be deployed independently and is
          subject to composition by third parties.”</i
        >

        <p class="loyd_p">
          Both of these definitions are based on the notion of a component as an
          element that is included in a system, rather than a service that is
          referenced by the system. However, they are also compatible with the
          idea of a service as a component.
        </p>
        <p class="loyd_p">
          Szyperski also states that a component has no externally observable
          state. This means that copies of components are indistinguishable.
          However, some component models, such as the Enterprise Java Beans
          model, allow stateful components, so these do not correspond with
          Szyperski’s definition. Although stateless components are certainly
          simpler to use, there are some systems where stateful components are
          more convenient and reduce system complexity.
        </p>
        <p class="loyd_p">
          What the above definitions have in common is that they agree that
          components are independent, and that they are the fundamental unit of
          composition in a system. In my view, a better definition of a
          component can be derived by combining these proposals.

        <p class="loyd_p">
          A useful way of thinking about a component is as a provider of one or
          more services. When a system needs a service, it calls on a component
          to provide that service without caring about where that component is
          executing or the programming language used to develop the component.
          For example, a component in a library system might provide a search
          service that allows users to search different library catalogs. A
          component that converts from one graphical format to another (e.g.,
          TIFF to JPEG) provides a data conversion service, etc.
        </p>
        <p class="loyd_p">
          Viewing a component as a service provider emphasizes two critical
          characteristics of a reusable component:
        </p>

        <ol class="list-decimal ml-6">
          <li>
            The component is an independent executable entity that is defined by
            its interfaces. You don’t need any knowledge of its source code to
            use it. It can either be referenced as an external service or
            included directly in a program.
          </li>
          <li>
            The services offered by a component are made available through an
            interface and all interactions are through that interface. The
            component interface is expressed in terms of parameterized
            operations and its internal state is never exposed.

        <p class="loyd_p">
          Components have two related interfaces, as shown in Figure 17.2. These
          interfaces reflect the services that the component provides and the
          services that the component requires to operate correctly:
        </p>

        <ul class="list-disc ml-6">
          <li>
            The ‘provides’ interface defines the services provided by the
            component. This interface, essentially, is the component API. It
            defines the methods that can be called by a user of the component.
            In a UML component diagram, the ‘provides’ interface for a component
            is indicated by a circle at the end of a line from the component
            icon.
          </li>
          <li>
            The ‘requires’ interface specifies what services must be provided by
            other components in the system if a component is to operate
            correctly. If these are not available, then the component will not
            work. This does not compromise the independence or deployability of
            a component because the ‘requires’ interface does not define how
            these services should be provided. In the UML, the symbol for a
            ‘requires’ interface is a semicircle at the end of a line from the
            component icon. Notice that ‘provides’ and ‘requires’ interface
            icons can fit together like a ball and socket.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p class="loyd_p">
          To illustrate these interfaces, Figure 17.3 shows a model of a
          component that has been designed to collect and collate information
          from an array of sensors. It runs autonomously to collect data over a
          period of time and, on request, provides collated data to a calling
          component. The ‘provides’ interface includes methods to add, remove,
          start, stop, and test sensors. The report method returns the sensor
          data that has been collected, and the list All method provides
          information about the attached sensors. Although not shown here, these methods have associated parameters specifying the sensor identifiers, locations, and related details.
        </p>

        <p class="loyd_p">
          The ‘requires’ interface is used to connect the component to the sensors. It assumes that sensors have a data interface, accessed through sensorData, and a management

          interface, accessed through sensorManagement. This interface has been
          designed to connect to different types of sensor so it does not
          include specific sensor operations such as Test, provideReading, etc.
          Instead, the commands used by a specific type of sensor are embedded
          in a string, which is a parameter to the operations in the ‘requires’
          interface. Adaptor components parse this string and translate the
          embedded commands into the specific control interface of each type of
          sensor. I discuss the use of adaptors later in this chapter, where I
          show how the data collector component is linked to a sen sor (Figure
          17.12).

        <p class="loyd_p">
          A critical difference between a component as an external service and a
          compo nent as a program element is that services are completely
          independent entities. They do not have a ‘requires’ interface.
          Different programs can use these services without the need to
          implement any additional support required by the service.

        <p class="loyd_p">
          A component model is a definition of standards for component
          implementation, documentation, and deployment. These standards are for
          component developers to ensure that components can interoperate. They
          are also for providers of component execution infrastructures who
          provide middleware to support component operation. Many component
          models have been proposed, but the most important models are now the
          WebServices model, Sun’s Enterprise Java Beans (EJB) model, and
          Microsoft’s .NET model (Lau and Wang, 2007).
        </p>
        <p class="loyd_p">
          The basic elements of an ideal component model are discussed by
          Weinreich and Sametinger (2001). I summarize these model elements in
          Figure 17.4. This diagram shows that the elements of a component model
          define the component interfaces, the information that you need to use
          the component in a program, and how a component should be deployed:

            Interfaces Components are defined by specifying their interfaces.
            The component model specifies how the interfaces should be defined
            and the elements, such as operation names, parameters, and
            exceptions, which should be included in the interface definition.
            The model should also specify the language used to define the
            component interfaces. For web services, this is WSDL, which I
            discuss in

            Chapter 19; EJB is Java-specific so Java is used as the interface
            definition lan guage; in .NET, interfaces are defined using the
            Common Intermediate Language (CIL). Some component models require
            specific interfaces that must be defined by a component. These are
            used to compose the component with the component model
            infrastructure, which provides standardized services such as
            security and transaction management.
          </p>
          <li>
            Usage In order for components to be distributed and accessed
            remotely, they need to have a unique name or handle associated with
            them. This has to be globally unique—for example, in EJB, a
            hierarchical name is generated with the root based on an Internet
            domain name. Services have a unique URI (Uniform Resource
            Identifier).
          </li>
          <p>
            Component meta-data is data about the component itself, such as
            information about its interfaces and attributes. The meta-data is
            important because it allows users of the component to find out what
            services are provided and required. Component model implementations
            normally include specific ways (such as the use of a reflection
            interface in Java) to access this component meta-data.
          </p>
          <p>
            Components are generic entities and, when deployed, they have to be
            configured to fit into an application system. For example, you could
            configure the Data collector component (Figure 17.2) by defining the
            maximum number of sensors in a sensor array. The component model may
            therefore specify how the binary components can be customized for a
            particular deployment environment.
          </p>
          <li>
            Deployment The component model includes a specification of how
            components should be packaged for deployment as independent,
            executable entities. Because components are independent entities,
            they have to be packaged with all supporting software that is not
            provided by the component infrastructure, or is not defined in a
            ‘requires’ interface. Deployment information includes information
            about the contents of a package and its binary organization.
            Inevitably, as new requirements emerge, components will have to be
            changed or replaced. The component model may therefore include rules
            governing when and how component replacement is allowed. Finally,
            the component model may define the component documentation that should be produced. This is used to find the component and to decide whether it is appropriate.

      <section class="loyd_content">
        <p class="loyd_p">For components that are implemented as program units rather than external services, the component model sets out the services to be provided by the middleware that supports the executing components. Weinreich and Sametinger (2001) use the analogy of an operating system to explain component models. An operating system provides a set of generic services that can be used by applications. A component model implementation provides comparable shared services for components. Figure 17.5 shows some of the services that may be provided by an implementation of a component model.</p>
        <p>The services provided by a component model implementation fall into two categories:</p>

        <ol class="list-decimal ml-6">
            <li>Platform services, which enable components to communicate and interoperate in a distributed environment. These are the fundamental services that must be available in all component-based systems.</li>
            <li>Support services, which are common services that are likely to be required by many different components. For example, many components require authentication to ensure that the user of component services is authorized. It makes sense to provide a standard set of middleware services for use by all components. This reduces the costs of component development and potential component incompatibilities can be avoided.</li>
        </ol>

        <p> The middleware implements the component services and provides interfaces to these services. To make use of the services provided by a component model infrastructure, you can think of the components as being deployed in a ‘container’. Acontainer is an implementation of the support services plus a definition of the interfaces that a component must provide to integrate it with the container. Including the component in the container means that the component can access the support services and the container can access the component interfaces. When in use, the component interfaces themselves are not accessed directly by other components; rather, they are accessed through a container interface that invokes code to access the interface of the embedded component.</p>
        <p class="loyd_p">Containers are large and complex, and when a component is deployed in a container, it gains access to all middleware services. However, simple components may not require all of the facilities provided by the supporting middleware. The approach taken in web services for common service provision is therefore quite different. In the case of web services, standards have been defined for common services such as transaction management and security, and these standards have been implemented as program libraries. When implementing a service component, developers only use the common services that are necessary.</p>
